# HLA-Histocompatability-Project

Taking de-identified DNA from the Hutch and generated high-quality HLA DNA sequence data and sharing our data in an XML-based file format called “Histoimmunogenetics Markup Language (HML).” This standardized format enables the sharing of HLA genetic information, which the conference organizers can easily parse to evaluate the performance of different methods and technologies. Our lab is new to the HLA typing space and has not previously worked with this file format. We need help automating the generation of these files!

Inputs
HLA star allele calls for 32 samples (data/allele_output.csv)
HLA coding DNA sequences for 32 samples (data/all_CDS.fasta)
HLA full gene DNA sequences for 32 samples (data/all_gene.fasta)
Additional metadata. As you become familiar with the .hml format, please create a list of the additional information you need from the lab to populate the file.
